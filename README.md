Hi there!

This repository contains Python projects and exercises built as part of my learning journey. The focus is on core Python concepts, problem-solving, and writing clean, readable code — while steadily improving structure and quality over time.

**Purpose:**
- Practice and strengthen Python fundamentals
- Apply concepts through small, focused real-world projects
- Build consistent coding habits
- Track technical growth over time
