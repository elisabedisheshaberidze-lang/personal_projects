# 🏦 Challenge #1 — ATM Cash Validator
# Your job: Write a Python program that:
# Asks the user to enter their account balance
# Asks how much they want to withdraw
# Checks these rules in order:
# Balance must be greater than 0
# Withdrawal amount must be greater than 0
# Withdrawal can't exceed balance
# ATM only dispenses multiples of 20 (e.g. 20, 40, 60… not 35)
# If all checks pass → print "✅ Dispensing $[amount]. New balance: $[remaining]"
# If any check fails → print a specific, helpful error message (not just "error")
